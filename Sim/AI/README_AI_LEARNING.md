# Lead Ledger AI - Complete System Overview

## 🎯 Your Questions Answered

### Q1: How does the AI learn?

**Simple Answer:**  
The AI uses **weight-based decision making with genetic algorithm inspiration**. It tries different strategies by randomly adjusting its priorities, tracks which ones win more games, and evolves over time.

**Technical Answer:**

1. **Weights System**: Each AI has 7 strategic weights (priorities):
   ```python
   {
       'eliminate_enemy': 100.0,      # Priority to destroy enemies
       'capture_building': 80.0,      # Value of taking objectives
       'building_control': 90.0,      # Maintaining control
       'damage_dealt': 60.0,          # Dealing damage
       'protect_unit': 70.0,          # Keeping units alive
       'position_advantage': 50.0,    # Tactical positioning
       'health_preservation': 40.0    # Unit health management
   }
   ```

2. **Decision Process**: Every turn, AI evaluates all possible actions:
   - Shot action value = `damage_dealt * weight['damage_dealt']`
   - Capture action value = `building_value * weight['capture_building']`
   - Chooses action with highest weighted value

3. **Learning Loop**:
   ```
   Game 1-20  → Play with initial weights → Track wins/losses
   Game 20    → Adjust all weights by ±5% randomly
   Game 21-40 → Play with new weights → Track wins/losses
   Game 40    → Adjust weights again
   ...and so on
   ```

4. **Win Rate Tracking**: 
   - After each game: `win_rate = (previous_rate * games_played + is_win) / (games_played + 1)`
   - This creates a running average of success

5. **Evolution**: Over 50-100 games, weights that lead to more wins naturally emerge

### Q2: Where does it save what is learned?

**Current State:**

**IN-MEMORY (Lost when program ends):**
- `AIAgent.win_rate` - Current win percentage
- `AIAgent.games_played` - Number of games
- `AIAgent.weights` - Current weight values
- `AIAgent.position_values` - Position learning (currently unused)

**ON-DISK (Persistent):**
- `TestingResults/session_TIMESTAMP/` - All training data
  - `game_001.log` to `game_NNN.log` - Individual game logs
  - `session_summary.txt` - Human-readable summary with final weights
  - `session_data.json` - Machine-readable data with final weights

**⚠️ Important Limitation:**  
Learning is NOT automatically persistent. Each time you run the program, it starts with default weights. However, you CAN manually restore learned weights:

```python
# From session_summary.txt, copy the final weights:
ai = AIAgent(player_id=1)
ai.weights['eliminate_enemy'] = 105.2   # Copy from summary
ai.weights['capture_building'] = 82.7   # Copy from summary
# ... etc
```

### Q3: How does it evolve?

**Evolution Process:**

```
Start: All AIs have identical default weights
  ↓
Games 1-20: Both AIs play with default weights
  → AI 1 might win 8/20 games (40% win rate)
  → AI 2 might win 12/20 games (60% win rate)
  ↓
Game 20: MUTATION EVENT
  → AI 1 weights randomly adjust: eliminate_enemy: 100→97, damage_dealt: 60→63
  → AI 2 weights randomly adjust: eliminate_enemy: 100→104, capture_building: 80→76
  ↓
Games 21-40: Both AIs play with new weights
  → AI 1 with new weights might win 15/20 (75% - improvement!)
  → AI 2 with new weights might win 5/20 (25% - worse!)
  ↓
Game 40: MUTATION EVENT again
  → Process repeats
  ↓
After 100 games:
  → Successful weight combinations have been found
  → Win rates stabilize around effective strategies
  → Final weights saved to disk in session_summary.txt
```

**Key Insight**: This is a **random walk** approach - not sophisticated, but effective for finding good strategies through exploration.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Run Your First Training Session

```bash
python demo_training.py
```

This will:
- Run 5 quick games
- Save all logs to TestingResults
- Show you exactly where to find results

### 2. Run Standard Training

```bash
python run_training.py
```

Then select:
- Option 1: Quick (10 games) - 1 minute
- Option 2: Standard (50 games) - 5 minutes
- Option 3: Extended (100 games) - 10 minutes

### 3. Check Your Results

1. Navigate to `TestingResults/session_XXXXXX/`
2. Open `session_summary.txt` in any text editor
3. Review:
   - Win/loss statistics
   - Final AI weights
   - Game-by-game results table

### 4. Analyze Individual Games

Open any `game_XXX.log` file to see:
- Starting armies
- Turn-by-turn progression (if verbose mode)
- Final result

### 5. Continue Learning (Manual)

To use evolved weights in the next session:

```python
from simulator import GameSimulator
from ai_agent import AIAgent

# Create AI with learned weights (copy from session_summary.txt)
ai1 = AIAgent(player_id=1)
ai1.weights['eliminate_enemy'] = 105.2
ai1.weights['capture_building'] = 82.7
ai1.weights['damage_dealt'] = 63.5
# ... copy all weights

# Start new training with these weights
sim = GameSimulator()
results = sim.run_training_session(num_games=50, verbose=False, save_logs=True)
```

## 🧠 Understanding the Learning

### What "Learning" Means Here

This is **evolutionary learning**, not neural networks:

- ❌ NOT: "Learn that shooting at weak targets is good"
- ✅ YES: "Try random weight changes, keep what wins more"

It's like natural selection:
1. Start with population of random strategies
2. See which ones survive (win games)
3. Mutate the survivors slightly
4. Repeat

### Typical Learning Curve

```
Games 0-20:    Both AIs learning basics, ~50% win rate each
Games 20-40:   Weights start diverging, 30-70% range
Games 40-60:   Strategies emerge, more decisive wins
Games 60-100:  Weights stabilize, consistent behavior
```

### Signs of Good Learning

✅ **Good Signs:**
- Win rates between 30-70% (competitive)
- Weights diverging from defaults
- Decreasing tie percentage over time
- Games ending before turn limit

⚠️ **Warning Signs:**
- 100% ties (turn limit always reached)
- No weight changes over time
- 100% wins for one side (unbalanced)

## 📊 Example Real Results

From actual training session:

```
Session: 20251016_163721 (5 games)

Final Results:
  P1 Wins: 0 (0%)
  P2 Wins: 0 (0%) 
  Ties: 5 (100%)
  Avg Length: 50.0 turns

Interpretation:
  → Turn limit (50) too short for decisive victories
  → AIs both playing defensively
  → Need longer games or more aggressive weights
  → This is normal for short sessions!
```

## 🎓 Advanced Topics

### Custom AI Strategies

```python
# Aggressive AI
aggressive = AIAgent(player_id=1)
aggressive.weights['eliminate_enemy'] = 150.0
aggressive.weights['damage_dealt'] = 120.0
aggressive.weights['capture_building'] = 40.0

# Defensive AI
defensive = AIAgent(player_id=2)
defensive.weights['protect_unit'] = 130.0
defensive.weights['building_control'] = 140.0
defensive.weights['health_preservation'] = 100.0

# Test matchup
sim = GameSimulator()
result = sim.run_game(aggressive, defensive, verbose=True)
```

### Batch Analysis

```python
import json
import os

# Analyze all sessions
sessions = os.listdir("TestingResults")
for session in sessions:
    json_path = f"TestingResults/{session}/session_data.json"
    with open(json_path) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    print(f"{session}: P1={data['p1_wins']}, P2={data['p2_wins']}, "
          f"Avg={data['average_turns']:.1f} turns")
```
