### Infantry
Infantry has full freedom of movement.

### Vehicles
In each movement a vehicle does, it can turn once in addition to moving forward 1 tile.
N, L and M Vehicles can turn and move in any order, but H must move forward and then turn.
Instead of moving, a vehicle can remain stationary and only turn. This still costs 1 tile of movement
Vehicles can also move backwards, following the same rules, but each tile moved costs double.
A Vehicle can only move into a tile if the slots it would occupy (given its future direction) are free. In this case, for non-H vehicles, consider the slots it would occupy after turning after the movement (and if it didn't already used this move's turn)

### Aircraft
Aircraft must always move when activated, and follows the same rules as Vehicles, with the exception that it cannot move backwards and cannot only turn.
Keep in mind that a lot of Aircraft Attack actions are influenced by how you move, not simply your final position.
2 Aircraft units cannot occupy the same position at any time. If they would, destroy both colliding units

### Hover
Hover units have full freedom of movement
