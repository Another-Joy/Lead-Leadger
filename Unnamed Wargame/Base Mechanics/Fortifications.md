Across the battlefield there will be various buildings and mission-relevant points.
Each building has a health pool, denoted by its colored pips. Each pip denoted not only the building health, but also its control. 

- At the start of the game, each uncontrolled building has all of its pips as a neutral color (white, grey, black).
- To gain control of an unoccupied building, move into and stay withing a building/point, spending the unit's activation. Turn the number pips of the unit's Control Stat on the building into your color. If you would turn a neutral pip, turn two instead.
- To gain control of an occupied building, you will need to fight for it, usually with infantry. This process if explained later.

When damaging a building, remove pips one at a time, always removing a pip of the most popular color. If there is a tie, remove a neutral pip, and if there are none, remove an enemy's pip
If there is a unit inside, for each pip that unit has higher than the buildings health, roll a d6. For each 4+, also roll for damage against that unit.
