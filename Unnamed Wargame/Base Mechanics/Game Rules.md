### Set Player Order
Randomly choose a player, that player chooses if they go first or second.

### Deploy armies
Each player, starting with the first, deploy a unit or structure of their choosing at a time.
The first deployment is made on any square of their edge, and the following can also be made on any tiles adjacent to already deployed on, up to 3 tiles from the edge. The players can deploy less than their capacity.
When deploying a unit, also choose how much ammunition it starts with.
Afterward, each player can finish their remaining capacity by leaving units in the Reserves, and the remaining units are considered out of battle.
