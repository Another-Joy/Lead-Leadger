## Tiers of Penetration
Each unit has a tier of armor:
- None: Clothes. No protection
- Light: Thin Metal. Sometimes bullet resistant
- Medium: Thick Steel. Impenetrable to bullets, weak vs HC rounds
- Heavy: Steel, Ceramics and the secret stuff. Good luck against this.
- Fortification: A building.

There are 3 types of ammo:
- Bullets: Small caliber guns and machine guns.
- Rounds: Tank and direct artillery ammo.
- Shells: Long range, indirect artillery ammo.

Each unit can have multiple guns, each with different effectiveness against each armor type.

Matching directly the ammo and the armor always gives a Wound*.

## Penetration Rolls
When checking penetration, roll a d6, and you score a Wound based on the result.

You will see the following symbols:
- 2- : Wound if you rolled a 2 or lower. This is "[[Definitions Archive#Rolling Down|Rolling Down]]"
- 4+: Wound if you rolled a 4 or higher. This is "[[Definitions Archive#Rolling Up|Rolling Up]]"

Modifier to your penetration affects vs all armor tiers, unless stated otherwise.
+1 AP means add 1 from your roll, so will be easier to penetrate heavier armor, but harder to deal damage to lighter armor. Remember that since is an effect on your roll, it reflects on the table as mirrored with unmodified rolls (a 5- on the table effectively means a 4- if you have +1AP, which are worse odds)

Protection X means you have -X AP if rolling up, or +X AP if rolling down. This means a Higher X makes a roll harder
## Armor Types
- Sloped: -2 AP, unless using Capped Rounds. Ignore this bonus if rolling down
- Spaced: -2 AP agains HE Rounds. Ignore this bonus if rolling down
- Reactive: -2AP vs DS Rounds. Ignore this bonus if rolling down
