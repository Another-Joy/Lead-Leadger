# Starting the Game

## Presentation Step
Each player must present all units on their army to each other

## Mission Choosing
Each player takes turns banning a mission of their choosing.
The last remaining mission is the active one.

## Map Setup
Based on the active mission, setup the map for it.
Maps are hexagonal with 8 tiles on each side (169 tiles total)

## Set Player Order
Randomly choose a player, that player chooses if they go first or second.

## Deploy armies
Each player, starting with the first, deploy a unit or structure of their choosing at a time.
The first deployment is made on any square of their edge, and the following can also be made on any tiles adjacent to already deployed on, up to 3 tiles from the edge. The players can deploy less than their capacity.
When deploying a unit, also choose how much ammunition it starts with.
Afterward, each player can finish their remaining capacity by leaving units in the Reserves, and the remaining units are considered out of battle.

## Starting Actions
Each player, in order, make any "Before the battle" actions.
Then, the Main Phase starts, with the first player beginning.


# Main Phase

## Tiles
The map is made up of a grid of hexagonal tiles. These tiles can be empty, have buildings, ally or enemy units in any combination.
- Any tile with a building in considered a Fortification Tile and can be targetted for Shooting
- Tiles with enemy units or enemy deployed buildings are considered Enemy Tiles
- Fortification Tiles with units inside are considered Occupied Buildings.

## Unit Activation
Each player activates one unit, then passes the turn to the other player.
The same unit can be activated any number of times in a row.

When activating a Unit, it can either make a move action or an attack action, unless stated otherwise.

## Move Actions
- Move the unit up to their Movement Stat. Restrictions are based on unit type and are explained in the "Extra Rules / Movement Restrictions" section.
	- Moving into buildings and into enemy tiles does not have an extra cost.
	- Moving out of Enemy Occupied Buildings and enemy tiles costs double movement.
- Disembark from a transport, by moving up to 1 tile.
- Embark into a transport, by moving up to 1 tile.


## Attack Actions
- Shoot a unit. Repeatable for each weapon the unit has that can shoot, and can target different units with different weapons. Attacking fortifications works differently, and is explained in the "Fortifications / Fortification Damage" section. 
	- The target unit must be within range of the weapon (denoted by R) and within LoS.
	- Check the targets Armor and the weapon's Penetration Roll.
	- Roll for penetration, then add any effect onto the rolled value
	- In case of success, remove 1 H from it.
- Capture a Building, by turning its Pips to your color. When turning pips, if you turn a neutral one, instead turn two.


# Fortifications

## Fortification Damage
When damaging a fortification, remove pips one at a time, always removing a pip of the most popular color. If there is a tie, remove a pip with the following priority, only removing from tied colors : neutral > enemy > ally

If there is an enemy unit inside, for each pip removed from the fortification, roll a d12. For each 9+, that unit looses 1 H.


## Fortification Health Checks
When a fortification has less health than the total of the units inside, each make attacks until the total of pips is lower or equal to the fortification's. The attacks are made in order of unit H, lower to higher, and starting with allied units in case of tie.



# Extra Rules

## Movement
### Infantry
Infantry has full freedom of movement.

### Vehicles
In each movement a vehicle does, it can turn once in addition to moving forward 1 tile.
N, L and M Vehicles can turn and move in any order, but H must move forward and then turn.
Instead of moving, a vehicle can remain stationary and only turn. This still costs 1 tile of movement
Vehicles can also move backwards, following the same rules, but each tile moved costs double.

A Vehicle can only move into a tile if the slots it would occupy (given its future direction) are free. In this case, for non-H vehicles, consider the slots it would occupy after turning after the movement (and if it didn't already used this move's turn)

### Aircraft
Aircraft must always move when activated, and follows the same rules as Vehicles, with the exception that it cannot move backwards and cannot only turn.
Keep in mind that a lot of Aircraft Attack actions are influenced by how you move, not simply your final position.
2 Aircraft units cannot occupy the same position at any time. If they would, destroy both colliding units

### Hover
Hover units have full freedom of movement

## Rolling

### Rolling Up
When the table show a number followed by a "+".
For this roll, you need to roll the shown number or higher.

### Rolling Down
When the table show a number followed by a "-".
For this roll, you need to roll the shown number or lower.
