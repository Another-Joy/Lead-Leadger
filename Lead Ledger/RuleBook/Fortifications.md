Across the battlefield there will be various buildings and mission-relevant points.
Each building has a health pool, denoted by its colored pips. Each pip denoted not only the building health, but also its control. 

- At the start of the game, each uncontrolled building has all of its pips as a neutral color (white, grey, black).
- To gain control of an unoccupied building, move into and stay withing a building/point, spending the unit's activation. Turn the number pips of the unit's Control Stat on the building into your color. If you would turn a neutral pip, turn two instead.
- To gain control of an occupied building, you will need to fight for it, usually with infantry. This process if explained later.

When damaging a fortification remove pips one at a time, always removing a pip of the most popular color. If there is a tie, remove a pip with the following priority, only removing from tied colors : neutral > enemy > ally

If there is an enemy unit inside, for each pip removed from the fortification, roll a d12. For each 9+, that unit looses 1 H.
